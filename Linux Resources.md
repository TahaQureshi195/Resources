People ask me where can I start learning Linux for cybersecurity I reply to them as just start using it as their main OS but I don't think that's a solution.
As Linux turned 30 years yesterday I thought that this is the best time to share resources.

Here is a list of Linux Resources to get you started in cybersecurity/networking :
